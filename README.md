# Ice Cream Shop

Welcome to the **Ice Cream Shop** project! üç¶ This is a responsive web mockup designed with HTML and CSS, utilizing the Grid System for a sleek layout. It showcases a delightful ice cream theme with a focus on desktop and mobile compatibility, though it‚Äôs purely a visual prototype with no functionality yet.

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile (below 430px) with adjusted grid areas and image scaling.
